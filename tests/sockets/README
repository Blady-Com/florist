This directory contains tests for the POSIX.5c socket interfaces.
The tests with names beginning with "p" are newest, and have all been
written based on the final approved version of the POSIX.5c standard.

The tests with names beginning with "test_" are legacy tests,
which have not been reviewed since the last few revisions of the
POSIX.5c standard during the ballot process; therefore they should be
viewed with skepticism.
